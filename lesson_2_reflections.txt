When you initialize a repository it means you have added a hidden folder called .git. The . means it is hidden. This then means you are able to begin tracking your repository. But you will need to commit yourself. This will not happen automatically. After you have created git init and initalized git in your repository then you will want to run git status to see that both files are listed as untracked files. 

The working directory is before you have put in your git init, so it is not being tracked. The staging area is the stage before you commit. It allows you greater control and means you can select specific things you would like to commit as opposed to everything inside your directory or repository. The repository is where all your folders are held that are connected by the git init and being tracked.
