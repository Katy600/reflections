When you initialize a repository it means you have added a hidden folder called .git. The . means it is hidden. This then means you are able to begin tracking your repository. But you will need to commit yourself. This will not happen automatically. After you have created git init and initalized git in your repository then you will want to run git status to see that both files are listed as untracked files. cs
